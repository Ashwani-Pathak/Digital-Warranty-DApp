## 🧾 **Project 2 – VerifyCert (Certificate Verification System)**

```markdown
# 🧾 VerifyCert: Blockchain-Based Certificate Verification System

## 📘 Overview
**VerifyCert** is a decentralized application that allows institutions to issue and verify certificates on the blockchain. Each certificate is identified by a unique hash and recorded immutably, ensuring authenticity and preventing forgery.

---

## 🎯 Vision
To eliminate fake certifications and create a **global standard for digital credential verification** using blockchain technology.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- **Certificate Issuance:** Authorized institutions can issue verifiable certificates.  
- **Certificate Verification:** Anyone can verify a certificate using its unique hash.  
- **Certificate Revocation:** Admin can revoke invalid or outdated certificates.  
- **Immutable Records:** All data is securely stored on the blockchain.
